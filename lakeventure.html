        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>A mobile app for weather and water conditions for lakes in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. This app will help users find a lake based on their water sports and preferences, provide detailed information and alerts for weather, and provide nearby resources for those who are unfamiliar with the area.

        <h2>Why LakeVenture?</h2>
        <p>There are many weather apps that give general information and forecasts, but…
        </p>
        <p>
        I decided to design an app that would solve specific problems and combine this with utilizing untapped niches to create an app that performs well and provides some new services.
        </p>
      </div>

          <img src="img/lakeventure/overview/niche_graphic@2x.png" alt="Niche Graphic">
        </picture>
        <h2>Niche</h2>
        <p>This app could stand out a number of ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Focus on a limited geographic location containing a lot of lake and water areas</li>
            <li>Provide an app with local, trusted, accurate weather data</li>
            <li>Provide user with customized trigger alerts for both optimal and severe weather</li>
            <li>A free or low cost app available across devices</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>My Process</h2>
        <h2>The Hypothesis: "How can I solve problems with the LakeVenture app?"</h2>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Users need a quick and reliable way to easily interpret water and weather information.</li>
          <li>Information will be customized for their activity and location.</li>
          <li>Some information needs to be accessed offline or without Wi-Fi.</li>
          <li>User control over notifications will enable them to stay safe and enjoy their time on the water.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <h2>Online Survey</h2>
        <p>To research the validity of the problem and strategize next steps, I began with an online survey to those in my target audience. I received 33 responses that enabled me to construct effective interview questions.
        </p>
        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <p>I brainstormed user stories for each feature to develop a user centered focus and to prepare for persona development.</p>
        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <p>The research goals for the interviews were slightly different than the survey goals:
        Goals: usefulness of certain features, attitudes, pain points, and social media habits.
        5 participants within my target user group, ages 29-70. I conducted an affinity mapping session to draw conclusions from the interviews.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoyed doing the actual mapping, but it took longer than I had expected to summarize results within (17) categories. However, I could better define the target demographic and begin planning for some of the app’s features.
        </p>
        <h2>User Research Takeaways</h2>

          <img src="img/lakeventure/research/kayak_lake@2x.jpg" alt="Lake Image">
        </picture>
        <ul>
          <li>Most users wanted a feature that would record conditions from a previous trip and mark a favorite spot for future private use.</li>
          <li>Features such as downloadable lake maps and GPS would be useful.</li>
          <li>Most users manually check the weather on a daily basis for at least several days prior to a trip, including the day of and sometimes on the water.</li>
          <li>A common pain point is that weather information from current apps they use is not reliable.</li>
          <li>Most users want a free or very low cost app for weather. If it has many features and reliable maps, then they are more likely to pay a one time fee.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <h2>User Personas</h2>
        <p>Once the surveys were complete, it was easy to develop some user personas. I created three unique personas that accurately represented the research-backed user needs.
        </p>
        <p>Meet Matt, a business owner who entertains clients sailing on his boat. He needs to plan ahead for them and keep a log of safety checks before these trips.
        </p>

        </picture>
        <p>Anna is a working mom and has a family lake home – she plans ahead for weekends there with extended family. More than once, there have been sudden severe storms and they’ve had to get off the lake quickly.
        </p>
        <picture>

        </picture>
        <p>Adam is an outdoorsman who takes more spontaneous driving trips to canoe and fish. He needs to know where to find supplies when he’s exploring a new area.

        </picture>
        <h2>User Journey Maps</h2>
        <p>I developed user journey maps to study some app experiences, users’ possible thoughts about them, and opportunities for features. Below is an example.
        This process seemed a bit artificial to me in the beginning, but it clearly helps designers and stakeholders see user needs in a realistic scenario and reveal opportunities within the features.
        </p>

        </picture>
        <h2>User Task Flows</h2>
        <p>User task flows helped me to begin to shape the Information Architecture (IA) by validating decisions for the site plan, and clarifying how the screens might progress within the features.
        </p>
        <p>For example, Matt’s user needs helped to define how the checklist feature might function.
        </p>

        </picture>
        <h2>Online Card Sort</h2>
        <p>I conducted an online hybrid card sort to help me revise the site plan. Respondents were provided with the main categories, but also an option to create new ones. I chose a hybrid card sort to save time and because of initial positive feedback from the first draft.
        </p>
        <p>The charts, lists, and visuals from the card sort helped me interpret the result data and compare it with the preliminary site map. I made some minor changes to produce the final site plan.
        </p>
        <h2>Site Map</h2>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>I began by hand sketching wireframes so I can edit them quickly and make notes in the margins. I used the “Crazy 8’s” method to begin sketching for LakeVenture.
        </p>

        </picture>
        <p>Using dot voting, I selected the sketches I liked best. Then I added text for clarity and mapped out some connections for a prototype.

        <h2>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>I used Figma to develop digital wireframes. Figma was a bit of a learning curve for me at first. I made a clickable prototype using Invision at a mid-fidelity level for user testing.

          <h2>User Testing</h2>
          <p>
            I conducted remote user testing sessions with a clickable prototype I made with InVision, using the mid-fidelity wireframes from Figma.
          </p>
          <p>Test Objectives:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Onboarding Screens - determine if participants easily understand the purpose of the app and how they might be able to use it</li>
              <li>Identify any problems with the Sign Up/Log In Screen</li>
              <li>Complete tasks: search for a lake, view weather details, set alerts or reminders and set optimal weather conditions</li>
            </ul>
          <p>After user testing, I categorized the observations, quotes and errors. I also used a rainbow spreadsheet. These all helped focus on the most critical errors to iterate upon next.
          </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Gestalt principles</li>
              <li>Grids for responsiveness and consistency</li>

          <h2>Takeways and Next Steps</h2>
          <p>Project Challenges:<br>
            I spent more time than I planned creating some of the icons and a logo. However, I did gain experience with these tools. Similarly, learning some new wireframing and prototyping software took time away from the project. In hindsight, I am now comfortable with plugins, UI kits, and layer naming conventions to speed up these processes.
          </p>
          <p>Next Steps:<br>
            Develop more features: safety and education, user profile, settings, map view filters
          </p>

            <li>Study specific user flows to develop additional features </li>
            <li>Confirm that maps can be adjusted by the user and that they can be read easily under various outdoor light conditions.</li>
            <li>Confirm the effectiveness of current navigation - focus on time spent on task and participant questions.</li>
            <li>Determine if the safety and education feature is valuable and utilized for specific water sports. To measure this, I would design software within the app to measure how often and how long users view video and articles. If 40% of users in a particular sport remain on the article screen longer than 20 seconds, it would be considered a useful feature.</li>

          <h2>Reflection: The Design Thinking Process for LakeVenture</h2>
          <p>The Design Thinking Process is an effective method to use. The circular iteration process is most effective because it allows for evaluation and creates opportunities to make changes. I have previous experience with user-centered design and the iterative process. Learning the point of view of users other than myself is critical for making design decisions, particularly in the beginning. Also, using the Double Diamond strategy allows me to explore many potential problems, narrow down the focus, and repeat the process for potential solutions. This approach lets me broaden my scope of ideas and not just settle on a narrow vision.

          <p>Design is an inherently ongoing process. Designers need to decide when to pause and deem it enough. As a designer, I try to be very loose and imperfect in the early stages. A lot of the early design may change during later iterations. However, sometimes stakeholders have difficulty visualizing how something will look or function, so a designer’s ability to quickly generate some higher fidelity wireframes or quick prototypes may prove very useful for effective discussions.
          </p>
          <p>Certain parts of the process are extremely valuable, and most parts are tightly connected. User testing quickly makes it evident which changes are needed. Both user testing and peer review resulted in the most improved iterations for this app. The Design Thinking Process will continue to be effective in developing more features and iterations of LakeVenture.
